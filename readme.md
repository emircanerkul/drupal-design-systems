## Drupal Design Systems

In this project, I demonstrate what design system are used and how works with Drupal.

To be able to do that, I'll use my [https://github.com/emircanerkul/psd-to-html](https://github.com/emircanerkul/psd-to-html) themes and I'll convert it into the drupal system.

#### Startuprr Landing Page Drupal 8, 9 Theme
Startuprr Landing Page Theme is for companies that only have one landing page and a contact form. In this project, i don't use any component system with paragraph or layout builder, or atomic design pattern. In this project, I only used core theme functionality and the power of the twig tweak module.

Integrating plain HTML to drupal gives all power of drupal to your static website. With drupal's power, you can extend your theme easily even if it's just one landing page. You can integrate your webform to any CRM application or you can do everything with a well-knowledged drupal developer.
