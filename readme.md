## Drupal 8, 9 Themes (Demonstration purposeful)

I'll migrate my [https://github.com/emircanerkul/psd-to-html](https://github.com/emircanerkul/psd-to-html) themes into the drupal system.
In this project, I want to demonstrate how design systems works on Drupal.

#### Startuprr Landing Page Drupal 8, 9 Theme
Startuprr Landing Page Theme is for companies that only have one landing page and a contact form. In this project, i don't use any component system with paragraph or layout builder, or atomic design pattern. In this project, I only used core theme functionality and the power of the twig tweak module.

Integrating plain HTML to drupal gives all power of drupal to your static website. With drupal's power, you can extend your theme easily even if it's just one landing page. You can integrate your webform to any CRM application or you can do everything with a well-knowledged drupal developer.
